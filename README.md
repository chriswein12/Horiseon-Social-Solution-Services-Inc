# **Horiseon** - Refactoring Website

## Description of the Project
The goal of this project was to refactor the website for Horiseon, updating the code but keeping all of the functionality and design elements in tact.

<br/>

## Specific Goals and How They Were Acheived
* Add Accesability features to Horiseon's website.
    * This was achieved by adding alt text and a title attribute to the main images on the page (note: alt text left blank for clip art on right side section as these are not important or easily describable images).
    * The title was also updated for the browser tab.
    * All broken links were fixed.

* Reduce any redundent coding for better organization and faster  updates in the future.
    * This was achieved by combining classes that shared the same css properties, and updating the class name and selector in both the html and css files.
    
* Improve readability for future developer updates to the code.
    * This was acheived by adding detailed comments to both the html & css files.    
    * Blocks of code were also reorganized to more closely follow the progression of the website from top to bottom.
